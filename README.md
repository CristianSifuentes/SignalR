## What is SignalR?

SignalR allows bi-directional communication between a server and connected clients, making it easy to push real-time updates from the server to client-side applications. It automatically manages the selection of the best transport mechanism (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long Polling) based on client and server capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Communication**:  
   - Enables real-time updates for web, desktop, and mobile applications.
2. **Automatic Transport Fallback**:  
   - Chooses the best transport mechanism (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or Long Polling).
3. **Group Management**:  
   - Allows grouping of clients for targeted communication.
4. **Scalability**:  
   - Supports horizontal scaling with Redis, Azure SignalR Service, and other backplanes.
5. **Hub-Based Communication**:  
   - Uses Hubs for high-level APIs to enable client-server communication.
6. **Cross-Platform Support**:  
   - Works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud environments.
7. **Secure Communication**:  
   - Supports authentication and authorization for connections.

## How SignalR Works

1. **Server**:  
   - Hosts a SignalR Hub that manages connections and handles communication logic.
2. **Client**:  
   - Connects to the server and subscribes to methods exposed by the Hub.
3. **Transport Mechanism**:  
   - Automatically negotiates the best transport based on server and client capabilities.
4. **Real-Time Updates**:  
   - Allows the server to push updates to connected clients in real-time.
