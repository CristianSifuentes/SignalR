# SignalR
SignalR allows bi-directional communication between a server and connected clients, making it easy to push real-time updates from the server to client-side applications. It automatically manages the selection of the best transport mechanism (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long Polling) based on client and server capabilities.
